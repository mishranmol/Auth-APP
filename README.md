# Auth-APP

Authentication (AuthN): Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity. It ensures that the entity claiming an identity is, in fact, who they say they are. The primary goal of authentication is to prevent unauthorized access to a system or resource.

Authorization (AuthZ): Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user or entity is allowed to access after successful authentication. It involves checking the permissions and privileges associated with the authenticated identity to ensure they have the appropriate rights to perform certain actions or access specific resources. Authorization is essential for maintaining the principle of least privilege, where users are only granted the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
